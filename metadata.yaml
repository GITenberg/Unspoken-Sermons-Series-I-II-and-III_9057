description: MacDonald rejected the doctrine of penal Substitutionary atonement as
  put forward by John Calvin which argues that Christ has taken the place of sinners
  and is punished by God in their place, believing that in turn it raised serious
  questions about the character and nature of God. Instead, he taught that Christ
  had come to save people from their sins, and not from a Divine penalty for their
  sins. The problem was not the need to appease a wrathful God but the disease of
  cosmic evil itself.
